Dataset
“This project leverages the Flickr8k dataset, which comprises over 8,000 images with 5 descriptive captions per image. It’s ideal for tasks like ours, focusing on generating textual descriptions for images. The dataset is stored in the ‘input’ directory for easy access.”

Training
“Captions are tokenized and padded to a maximum length of 35 words for uniformity. To optimize memory usage, we use a custom data generator to load and process data in batches during training. We also ensure proper data splitting, with 90% of the dataset for training and 10% for validation.”

Results
“Our model delivers captions that describe images effectively. For example, given an input image of a dog playing with a frisbee, the output caption might read: ‘A dog playing with a frisbee in a park.’ This showcases the model’s ability to combine image features with natural language for accurate descriptions.”

Acknowledgements
“This project draws inspiration from various online resources and research papers on image captioning. Special thanks to the creators of the Flickr8k dataset and the TensorFlow/Keras community for providing the tools and pre-trained models that made this possible.”
